## Overview

The project for the subject Sistemas Distribuídos (Distributed Systems) consists in the implementation of cloud computing services with Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) functionality.
With this project we aim to design and develop a cloud computing service capable of executing user-defined functions in a distributed environment. The core functionality revolves around enabling clients to submit task code for execution on remote servers, with an emphasis on efficient resource utilization and scalability.
